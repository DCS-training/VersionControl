# Git, Gitlab and Github  a Self-Learn Guide

  

## Intro

This is a short guide to help you find good resources to learn Git, GitLab and GitHub. It collects both video tutorial and webpages.

The first section cover the principles of git and version control and it is based on the video course available at [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics/use-git-version-control-software-to-manage-project-code?u=50251009.).

The  Second section cover the use of Github, and the third the use of GitLab. The GitHub section uses a basic training available at the [Github lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github), while the GitLab part uses a video-tutorial from [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-gitlab-2/version-control-and-more?u=50251009).

  

## Git and Version Control

Git is a free and opensource distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)).

Version control is a system that records every change to your files or set of files and will allow you to revert to a specific version later. Additionally, it is a very useful tool for those who need to work on a shared project.

## Using GitHub

[GitHub](http://github.com/) is a global company that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. In 2018, it became a subsidiary of Microsoft It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. It is by far the most used system for building shared code.

This section of the class is based on [this](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) tutorial from GitHub.

The GitHub bot will follow you on a series of task you can perform in GitHub. The topics covered are the following:

-   What is GitHub?
    
-   The GitHub workflow
    
-   Creating branches
    
-   Making a commit
    

-   Creating and merging pull requests
    
-   Creating a new project
    
-   Moving the project to GitHub
    
-   Working with teams on GitHub

## Using GitLab

Like GitHub, GitLab is a repository manager which lets teams collaborate on code. Written in Ruby and Go, GitLab offers some similar features for issue tracking and project management as GitHub. It is the system currently used by the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.digitalresearchservices.ed.ac.uk/resources/gitlab).
